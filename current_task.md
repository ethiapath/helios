### 🔄 Current Issues (Minor)

**Health Check Resolution Required:**
- [ ] Risk engine health check failing due to historical data API calls
  - Issue: `'Account' object has no attribute 'day_trade_count'` (API compatibility)
  - Issue: Historical data not available for recent dates (weekend/market hours)
  - Status: Non-critical - safety feature working as designed
  - Impact: System refuses to start until all modules pass health checks

**Estimated Resolution Time:** 1-2 hours

   - [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for weekend/off-hours testing
   - [ ] Validate all health checks pass during market hours

2. **Comprehensive Testing (CRITICAL)**
   - [ ] End-to-end system testing with live API
   - [ ] Safety mechanism activation testing
   - [ ] Kill switch functionality validation
   - [ ] State persistence and recovery testing
   - [ ] Paper trading simulation setup

3. **Final Documentation & Deployment**
   - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting section to README
   - [ ] Create deployment checklist
   - [ ] Final code review and cleanup

4. **Unit Test Implementation**
